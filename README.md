# Housing-Price-Prediction
Housing prices of a dummy real estate agent data, This is to build and train a model that will make predictions of future housing prices


Task: Build a Linear Regression Model for House Price prediction.

I expect to see the following:


- Data Vizualization & EDA
- Data Preprocessing
- Building A Machine Learning Model & Making Predictions using either (sklearn or the manual approach)
- Evaluate Performance Of Your Regression Model Using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## Deviating from the main task, I will be focusing on:
- Data Visualization & EDA
- Data Preprocessing
